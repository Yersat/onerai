# Freedom Pay Signature Validation Fix

## Problem Summary

The Freedom Pay integration was failing with "Invalid response signature from Freedom Pay" errors during the checkout process. This was causing payment initialization to fail and users to be redirected back to the cart page instead of proceeding to payment.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the signature verification process for Freedom Pay API responses. The original implementation was using an empty script name (`''`) for response signature verification, but Freedom Pay actually uses the same script name (`'init_payment.php'`) for both request and response signatures.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Response Signature Verification

**Before:**
```python
# Generate expected signature (empty script name for responses)
expected_signature = self.generate_signature('', verify_params)
```

**After:**
```python
# Generate expected signature (use 'init_payment.php' script name for responses)
expected_signature = self.generate_signature('init_payment.php', verify_params)
```

### 2. Enhanced Logging and Debugging

- Added comprehensive logging to track signature generation and verification
- Added debug function to automatically test different script names when signatures don't match
- Improved error messages to help with troubleshooting

### 3. Maintained Correct Callback Handling

Callback signatures (for result_url) still use empty script name as per Freedom Pay documentation:
```python
# Generate expected signature (empty script name for callbacks)
expected_signature = self.generate_signature('', verify_params)
```

## Key Findings

1. **Payment Initialization Responses**: Use script name `'init_payment.php'`
2. **Result Callbacks**: Use empty script name `''`
3. **Signature Format**: `script_name;param1;param2;...;secret_key` (all joined with semicolons)
4. **Parameter Sorting**: Parameters must be sorted alphabetically by key

## Testing

### Automated Tests

Run the provided test scripts to verify the fix:

```bash
# Test signature generation
python test_freedompay_signature.py

# Test API integration
python test_freedompay_api.py

# Test complete payment flow
python test_complete_payment_flow.py
```

### Manual Testing

1. **Start the Django server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **Create a test order:**
   - Add products to cart
   - Go to checkout
   - Fill in shipping information
   - Click "Отправить заявку на оплату"

3. **Verify payment initialization:**
   - Should redirect to Freedom Pay payment page
   - Check Django logs for successful signature verification
   - No "Invalid response signature" errors should appear

4. **Test payment completion:**
   - Use Freedom Pay test cards for payment
   - Verify callback processing works correctly
   - Check order status updates

## Configuration

Ensure your `.env` file has the correct Freedom Pay credentials:

```bash
# Freedom Pay settings (Real credentials)
FREEDOM_PAY_MERCHANT_ID=561533
FREEDOM_PAY_SECRET_KEY=AD0uCy2bDpPkTmZ9
FREEDOM_PAY_API_URL=https://test-api.freedompay.kz
FREEDOM_PAY_TESTING_MODE=1
```

## Logging Configuration

The fix includes enhanced logging. Check `django.log` file or console output for detailed signature verification information:

- `INFO` level: Basic signature verification results
- `DEBUG` level: Detailed signature generation process
- `ERROR` level: Signature mismatches and debugging information

## Production Deployment

1. **Update the code** with the signature fix
2. **Test thoroughly** in staging environment
3. **Monitor logs** for any signature-related issues
4. **For production**, set `FREEDOM_PAY_TESTING_MODE=0` and use production API URL

## Files Modified

- `store/freedompay_service.py`: Fixed signature verification logic
- `onerai/settings.py`: Added logging configuration
- Added test scripts for verification

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check if signature generation works correctly
python -c "
import os, sys, django
sys.path.insert(0, '.')
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'onerai.settings')
django.setup()
from store.freedompay_service import FreedomPayService
service = FreedomPayService()
print('✅ Freedom Pay service initialized successfully')
print(f'Merchant ID: {service.merchant_id}')
print(f'API URL: {service.api_url}')
"

# Test database connection
python manage.py check

# Run migrations if needed
python manage.py migrate
```

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the Django logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify Freedom Pay credentials are correct
3. Ensure the test environment is properly configured
4. Run the provided test scripts to isolate the issue

The signature verification fix resolves the core issue that was preventing successful payment processing with Freedom Pay.
