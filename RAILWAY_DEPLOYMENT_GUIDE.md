## üîß Step-by-Step Deployment

### **Step 1: Create Railway Project**
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign in
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose your onerai repository

### **Step 2: Set Up PostgreSQL Database**
1. In your Railway project, click "New Service"
2. Select "Database" ‚Üí "PostgreSQL"
3. Railway will automatically create the database and provide connection variables

### **Step 3: Deploy onerai Service**
1. Click "New Service" ‚Üí "GitHub Repo"
2. Select your repository
3. Railway will detect it's a Python project
4. Set the **Root Directory** to `/` (main project)
5. Add all onerai environment variables listed above
6. Deploy will start automatically

### **Step 4: Deploy partners_onerai Service**
1. Click "New Service" ‚Üí "GitHub Repo"
2. Select the same repository
3. Set the **Root Directory** to `/partners_onerai`
4. Add all partners_onerai environment variables listed above
5. Deploy will start automatically

### **Step 5: Configure Custom Domains**
1. In onerai service settings:
   - Go to "Settings" ‚Üí "Domains"
   - Add custom domain: `onerai.kz`
   - Configure DNS: Add CNAME record pointing to Railway URL

2. In partners_onerai service settings:
   - Go to "Settings" ‚Üí "Domains"
   - Add custom domain: `partners.onerai.kz`
   - Configure DNS: Add CNAME record pointing to Railway URL

### **Step 6: Run Database Migrations**
1. In onerai service, go to "Deployments"
2. Click on latest deployment ‚Üí "View Logs"
3. Migrations should run automatically via Procfile
4. If needed, manually run: `python manage.py migrate`

## üîç Verification Steps

### **Test onerai Service**
1. Visit `https://onerai.kz`
2. Check homepage loads correctly
3. Test product browsing
4. Test user registration/login
5. Test Freedom Pay integration

### **Test partners_onerai Service**
1. Visit `https://partners.onerai.kz`
2. Test creator registration
3. Test design upload functionality
4. Verify API communication with onerai

### **Test Inter-Service Communication**
1. Submit a design from partners_onerai
2. Check if it appears in onerai admin
3. Verify file transfers work correctly

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**Build Failures:**
- Check Python version compatibility
- Verify all dependencies in requirements.txt
- Check Railway build logs

**Database Connection Issues:**
- Verify PostgreSQL service is running
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure both services use same database

**Static Files Not Loading:**
- Verify `python manage.py collectstatic` runs in Procfile
- Check whitenoise is installed and configured

**API Communication Fails:**
- Verify API_KEY matches in both services
- Check ONERAI_API_URL points to correct domain
- Test internal Railway networking

## üìä Expected Costs

**Railway Pricing (Estimated Monthly):**
- PostgreSQL Database: ~$5-15
- onerai Service: ~$5-20
- partners_onerai Service: ~$5-15
- **Total: ~$15-50/month**

*Costs depend on usage, storage, and bandwidth*

## üîÑ Deployment Updates

**To update your applications:**
1. Push changes to GitHub
2. Railway automatically redeploys
3. Monitor deployment logs
4. Test functionality after deployment

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
